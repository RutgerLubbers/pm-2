The frontend is split in modules. In case you are not working on
these modules, you need to install them before you can use your
Vagrant image.

You can install the following modules:
* vfz-module-account (also known as IDM Frontend)
* vfz-module-cobrowsing

If you are a developer of one of these modules, you do not need
to install them. You need to clone the repository and build the
module yourself.

If you are not one of the developers (or if you don't know what
this is), install each module in your Vagrant image now (after
you have configured your network connection in the previous step).

${YELLOW}Make sure you have your hawaii.conf correctly set up,
${YELLOW}check the module's versions!
${YELLOW}NOTE: You must repeat this each time you wish to install a
${YELLOW}      new version.

Enter your vagrant image with :
 $ vagrant ssh

And then, for each module you wish to install:
 $ sudo do-install vfz-module-account
 $ sudo do-install vfz-module-cobrowsing
